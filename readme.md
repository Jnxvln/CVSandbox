# Setup
(Open any links in a new tab to keep this visible)

Hey man! Before we have fun, we just have to do some ugly setup stuff. It's usually a one-time thing though, once you're set up you're good to go. 

### We need: **Git** and a **code editor**.

For Windows, you need **GitBash** which comes with a Linux terminal *and* Git. 
Just make sure to get the correct installer (32-bit or 64-bit depending on your computer's operating system.)

[Windows: GitBash (comes with Git)](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.27.0.windows.1)

### Code Editor
You'll also need a good code editor. You may already have one, but if not I **highly** recommend **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**. 

If you decide to install and run it, click on the **Extensions button** on the far left and type in "Python" and install the first one that pops up (Python by Microsoft)

Last thing, we need to tell it we want to use the GitBash terminal *rather than* the traditional Windows Command Line Prompt

1. Open Visual Studio Code (close all projects, nothing should be open)

2. Click "Terminal" > "New Terminal" up top in the menu bar

3. Open the command palette using Ctrl + Shift + P.

4. Start typing "Select Default Shell" and choose it when it appears

5. Select Git Bash from the options

6. Click on the + icon in the terminal window.

7. The new terminal should now be a Git Bash terminal. Give it a few seconds to load Git Bash (may have to restart VSCode)

Even if you don't *have* to restart VSCode, I would restart it anyway so you can make sure it works. Restart it, click "Terminal" > "New Terminal", and see if the terminal looks different now (should have green, purple, & yellow colors)


# Now What?
At this point, call me when we both have some free time, I usually get home around 5pm-ish during the week and 1pm on Saturdays. I'm off on Sundays for now.

If you don't already know some terminal commands, we'll have to learn a few. They're dead simple and easy to use, and you'll use them **a lot** so no worries! If you want to learn some before we chat,

[Here's an awesome cheat sheet for Linux terminal commands](https://www.linuxtrainingacademy.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet/)

Read #5 and #15. As long as you know how to change directories, create, move, copy, and delete files/folders. That's the main takeaway.

### WARNING
Just be VERY careful, shell commands are *not* reversible. There's no undo or Ctrl+Z, if you delete a file or folder, it's permanently gone, so just be careful. I would make a practice folder on your computer somewhere and practice making files, folders, deleting those, etc. in *that* folder. Just make sure to never do it on one of your computer's folders until you are more comfortable.
