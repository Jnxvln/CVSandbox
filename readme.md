# Setup
(Open any links in a new tab to keep this visible)

Hey man! Before we have fun, we just have to do some ugly setup stuff. It's usually a one-time thing though, once you're set up you're good to go. 

### We need: **Git**, and a **code editor**. If you're on a Mac or Linux, you also need **Homebrew**.

### What Is Git?
*Git* tracks changes made to our code and allows you to *push* those changes to the repository (or 'repo') which is the GitHub link up in the address bar above. From there, I *pull* (or download) those changes to my machine. Then I make my changes/additions and *push* my code to the repo as well. You *pull* those changes, and the cycle just keeps going, pushing and pulling. It's mean as hell when you think about it :laughing:

## Download Links

### Windows

If you're on a Windows computer, you need **GitBash** which comes with a Linux terminal *and* Git. 
Just make sure to get the correct installer (32-bit or 64-bit depending on your computer's operating system.)

[Windows: GitBash (comes with Git)](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.27.0.windows.1)

### Mac & Linux
Mac & Linux just need to install **Homebrew** and **Git**. Homebrew is basically a package manager that allows you to download programs to your machine from the web. Think of it like a command-prompt version of Window's GUI installers. (Ever installed a game or a program on a Windows machine and had click next, next, next, yes, next, next, Done?? Same thing basically.)

Homebrew will allow you to install Git on your machine easily.

[Mac/Linux: Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) -- Download first, then come back and download Git below

[Mac/Linux: Git](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) -- Install using Homebrew (instructions on website)



### Code Editor
You'll also need a good code editor. You may already have one, but if not I **highly** recommend **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**. If you decide to install and run it, click on the **Extensions button** on the far left and type in "Python" and install the first one that pops up (Python by Microsoft)

That's about it! If you end up using Visual Studio Code & you're on Windows, let me know, there's one or two more adjustments we'll have to make, but other than that I *thiinkkkk* we should be good to go.

# Now What?
At this point, call me when we both have some free time, I usually get home around 5pm-ish during the week and 1pm on Saturdays. I'm off on Sundays for now.

If you don't already know some terminal commands, we'll have to learn a few. They're dead simple and easy to use, and you'll use them **a lot** so no worries! If you want to learn some before we chat,

[Here's an awesome cheat sheet for Linux terminal commands](https://www.linuxtrainingacademy.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet/)

Read #5 and #15. As long as you know how to change directories, create, move, copy, and delete files/folders. That's the main takeaway.

### WARNING
Just be VERY careful, Linux commands are *not* reversible. There's no undo or Ctrl+Z lol! If you delete a file or folder, it's permanently gone, so just be careful. I would just make a practice folder on your computer somewhere and practice making files, folders, deleting those, etc. in *that* folder. Just make sure to never do it on one of your computer's folders until you are more comfortable.
