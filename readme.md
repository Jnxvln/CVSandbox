# Setup
(Open any links in a new tab to keep this visible)

1. If you don't already have it, [download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   - If you have a 64-bit operating system download that version, otherwise choose the 32-bit link
   - If you're not sure about the installer questions, the defaults should be fine
2. If you're on Windows, [download and install GitBash](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.27.0.windows.1)
   - If you're on a MacOS, no need to install GitBash
   - Same thing, choose 64-bit or 32-bit based on your operating system
   - Defaults during install should work fine

3. You'll need a code editor. You probably already have one, but if not I **highly** recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Once you install and run it, click on the **Extensions button** on the far left and type in "Python" and install the first one that pops up (Python by Microsoft)

4. That's about it! If you end up using Visual Studio Code, let me know, there's one or two more adjustments we'll have to make, but other than that I *thiinkkkk* we should be good to go.
